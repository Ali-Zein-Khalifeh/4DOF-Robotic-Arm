4DOF Robotic Arm Joint Control System (Simulink + Stateflow + Arduino)

This project implements a manual control interface for a 4-DOF robotic arm, using MATLAB/Simulink, Stateflow, and automatic Arduino code generation.
The system allows the user to select a joint, adjust its angle, and confirm the new position, with real-time hardware-in-loop validation in SimulIDE.



Project Overview

The system enables:

Selecting one of the four robotic arm joints (J1, J2, J3, J4)

Adjusting the selected joint angle through a potentiometer

Confirming the new angle using a dedicated button

Driving servo motors connected to the Arduino

Visualizing and validating the whole system in SimulIDE

A Stateflow state machine controls transitions between joints and manages safe updates of angles.



Two digital inputs:

SelectJointsForward

SelectJointsBackward

Stateflow timers ensure transitions occur only when buttons are held for the required duration.

✔ Joint Angle Adjustment

Potentiometer input on A1

Angle mapped from analog input → 0° to 180°

Confirmation button ensures accidental adjustments are avoided

✔ Joint Value Holding

When switching joints:

Previously updated angles are stored and held

Only the active joint receives new angle values

✔ Servo Motor Control

Each joint controls a servo:

J1 → Pin 10

J2 → Pin 9

J3 → Pin 6

J4 → Pin 5

State indicators output on:

state1 → Pin 2

state2 → Pin 4

state3 → Pin 7

state4 → Pin 8

🧪 Hardware-in-loop Simulation (SimulIDE)

The controller is tested in SimulIDE with:

4 servo motors

Potentiometer

Push buttons (Next, Previous, Confirm)

State LEDs

Arduino Uno

Real-time behavior matches Simulink outputs, validating the design.
